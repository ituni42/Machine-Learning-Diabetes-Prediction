‚û§ What's This About?

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for a real-world classification problem. The goal is to build a highly accurate model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on key medical attributes.

We tackle common data science challenges head-on, including:

    üßπ Cleaning Messy Data: Dealing with outliers and inconsistencies.

    üìä Exploratory Analysis: Using visualization to understand data patterns.

    ‚öñÔ∏è Class Imbalance: Correcting for a skewed dataset to ensure fair model evaluation.

    üß† Advanced Modeling: Moving beyond simple models to implement and compare powerful Stacking, Bagging, and Boosting ensembles.

‚ú® Tech Stack

This project is built with a standard, powerful set of data science tools:

    Python: The core programming language.

    Pandas: For all data manipulation and cleaning tasks.

    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful data visualizations.

    Scikit-Learn: The heart of our modeling, used for feature engineering, training, and evaluation.

    Imbalanced-learn: A key library for correcting class imbalance with undersampling.

‚öôÔ∏è The Project Pipeline

The repository is structured as a series of scripts, each performing a specific step in the workflow. For best results, run them in the following order.
#	File	Purpose
1	DataFiltering.py	From raw data to a clean dataset. Handles outliers and inconsistencies.
2	ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py	Dives deep into the data with visualizations to uncover trends.
3	Feature... .py	Prepares the data for modeling through scaling & one-hot encoding.
4	DataBalancing.py	Fixes the class imbalance problem using undersampling.
5	GridSearch.py	Fine-tunes baseline models to find the optimal hyperparameters.
6	ResiProjekat.py	The final showdown: trains and evaluates advanced ensemble models.
