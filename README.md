The Mission

This project is more than just a model.fit() call. It's a deep dive into the practical data science workflow, designed to build a robust and reliable diabetes classifier from the ground up.

We start with raw, real-world health data and guide it through a rigorous pipeline of cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and modeling. The final goal? To not only predict outcomes but also to uncover the most influential health markers that point to a diabetes diagnosis using advanced ensemble techniques and feature importance analysis.
Tech Stack

This project leverages a powerful stack of open-source libraries:

    [Python] - The core language for everything.

    [Pandas] - For data manipulation, cleaning, and wrangling.

    [Matplotlib & Seaborn] - For creating insightful and rich data visualizations.

    [Scikit-Learn] - The heart of our machine learning pipeline, used for modeling, scaling, and evaluation.

    [Imbalanced-learn] - The key to solving class imbalance and building a fair model.

The Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è

The project is broken down into a logical sequence of scripts, each performing a critical task. To reproduce the results, run them in this order:

    DataFiltering.py

        Taming the Beast: Wrestles with the raw dataset, removes statistical outliers, and creates a clean foundation for analysis.

    ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py

        Visual Storytelling: Uses plots and charts to uncover the data's hidden patterns and initial correlations.

    FeatureScaling.py & FeatureEncoding.py

        Prep School: Scales numerical features and one-hot encodes categorical data, making it ready for the machine learning models.

    DataBalancing.py

        Leveling the Playing Field: Tackles the dataset's significant class imbalance with undersampling to prevent a biased model.

    GridSearch.py

        The Tune-Up: Runs an exhaustive hyperparameter search to find the optimal settings for our baseline classifiers.

    ResiProjekat.py

        The Grand Finale: Deploys advanced ensemble models (Stacking, Bagging, Boosting), evaluates their performance with metrics like AUC-ROC, and reveals which features matter most.
