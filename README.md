### ‚û§ About The Project

This project demonstrates a practical approach to solving a real-world classification problem. The primary goal is to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on key medical indicators.

The pipeline addresses several critical data science challenges, including:
*   **Data Cleaning**: Tackling outliers and inconsistent data entries.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using visualizations to uncover insights and correlations.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Preparing data for modeling through scaling and encoding.
*   **Handling Class Imbalance**: Using undersampling to build a fair and unbiased model.
*   **Advanced Modeling**: Implementing and comparing powerful ensemble techniques like **Stacking**, **Bagging**, and **Boosting**.

### ‚ú® Built With
This project relies on a standard stack of powerful data science libraries:
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
*   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) & [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
*   [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
*   [Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The repository is structured as a sequence of Python scripts, each performing a specific step. They are designed to be run in the following order to reproduce the full pipeline.

| # | Script Name | Purpose |
| :-- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `DataFiltering.py` | Cleans the raw dataset by removing outliers and invalid entries. |
| 2 | `ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py` | Generates visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships. |
| 3 | `FeatureScaling.py` & `FeatureEncoding.py` | Normalizes numerical data and converts categorical data into a machine-readable format. |
| 4 | `DataBalancing.py` | Addresses the class imbalance in the target variable using random undersampling. |
| 5 | `GridSearch.py` | Performs hyperparameter tuning on baseline models to find the best configurations. |
| 6 | `ResiProjekat.py` | Trains, tests, and evaluates the final ensemble models, reporting key performance metrics. |
