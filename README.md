<h1 align="center">Diabetes Prediction Pipeline</h1>
<p align="center">
An end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes from health data. This repository walks through the complete data science workflow, from initial data cleaning to advanced model evaluation.
</p>
‚û§ About The Project

This project demonstrates a practical approach to solving a real-world classification problem. The primary goal is to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on key medical indicators.

The pipeline addresses several critical data science challenges, including:

    Data Cleaning: Tackling outliers and inconsistent data entries.

    Exploratory Data Analysis: Using visualizations to uncover insights and correlations.

    Feature Engineering: Preparing data for modeling through scaling and encoding.

    Handling Class Imbalance: Using undersampling to build a fair and unbiased model.

    Advanced Modeling: Implementing and comparing powerful ensemble techniques like Stacking, Bagging, and Boosting.

‚ú® Built With

This project relies on the following core data science libraries:

    Python

    Pandas

    Matplotlib & Seaborn

    Scikit-Learn

    Imbalanced-learn

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The repository is structured as a sequence of Python scripts, each performing a specific step. They are designed to be run in the following order to reproduce the full pipeline.
#	Script Name	Purpose
1	DataFiltering.py	Cleans the raw dataset by removing outliers and invalid entries.
2	ExploratoryDataAnalysis.py	Generates visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
3	FeatureScaling.py & FeatureEncoding.py	Normalizes numerical data and converts categorical data into a machine-readable format.
4	DataBalancing.py	Addresses the class imbalance in the target variable using random undersampling.
5	GridSearch.py	Performs hyperparameter tuning on baseline models to find the best configurations.
6	ResiProjekat.py	Trains, tests, and evaluates the final ensemble models, reporting key performance metrics.
